# *MRSIPrep*: A Robust Preprocessing Pipeline for Whole-Brain MRSI Data

*MRSIPrep* is a preprocessing and derivative-generation pipeline for already
quantified whole-brain MRSI maps, run as a BIDS App via Docker.

## About

`MRSIPrep` does not perform spectral fitting. It expects quantified MRSI
maps, quality maps, and T1w images as input, and produces BIDS-organized
derivatives: filtered/normalized MRSI maps, tissue probability maps,
anatomical parcellations, and regional metabolite tables. It is derived from
the implementation in `MRSI-Metabolic-Connectome` and preserves the CHUV
academic non-commercial research license.

## What it uses

- **[ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/)** for MRSI↔T1w and T1w↔MNI registration.
- **[FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)** (`mri_synthseg`, `recon-all`, `mri_vol2vol`) for brain
  extraction, cortical/subcortical parcellation, and surface reconstruction.
- **[FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) FAST** for tissue-class probability segmentation.
- **[PETPVC](https://github.com/UCL/PETPVC)** for partial-volume correction of MRSI maps.
- **[Chimera](https://github.com/connectomicslab/chimera)** for multi-atlas cortical/subcortical parcellation
  fusion.
- **[TemplateFlow](https://www.templateflow.org/)** for the bundled MNI152 reference templates and atlases.

## Pipelines

MRSIPrep runs in one of two modes, selected with `--mode`:

- **Light mode** — registers MRSI maps to a SynthSeg-extracted T1w image,
  resamples to the requested output spaces, and parcellates with SynthSeg
  cortical/subcortical labels. No tissue PVC, no Chimera, no `recon-all`.
  This is the fast default path for anatomical coverage and CRLB reporting.
- **Full mode** — adds SynthSeg+FAST tissue probability maps, partial-volume
  correction, and a choice of Chimera multi-atlas or bundled MNI-atlas
  parcellation, plus optional perturbation-based connectivity matrices.

Both modes share the same MRSI filtering, quality-masking, and T1w/MNI
normalization machinery; full mode is a superset of light mode's outputs.

## Design Principles

MRSIPrep was designed according to four main principles: reproducibility,
modularity, transparency, and analysis agnosticism.

### Reproducibility

The framework is distributed as open-source software and can be executed in
containerized environments to minimize differences across computing
platforms.

### Modularity

Each processing stage is implemented as an independent module, allowing
users to enable, disable, or replace specific steps according to their
acquisition protocol and scientific question.

### Transparency

MRSIPrep generates automated quality-control reports summarizing spatial
registration, metabolite coverage, voxel-level quality metrics, tissue
composition, and atlas projection.

### Analysis Agnosticism

MRSIPrep does not impose a specific downstream analysis. Instead, it
generates standardized derivatives that can be used for voxelwise analyses,
regional analyses, metabolic connectomics, gradient mapping, or
machine-learning workflows.

## Workflow Architecture

### Inputs

MRSIPrep starts from quantified metabolite maps and associated quality
metrics. Typical inputs include metabolite concentration maps, Cramér-Rao
lower bound maps, signal-to-noise ratio maps, linewidth maps, anatomical
T1-weighted images, tissue probability maps, and optional atlas files.

### Processing Steps

The core processing workflow includes:

1. MRSI-BIDS-compatible data import.
2. Voxelwise quality assessment.
3. Brain masking and coverage estimation.
4. Tissue fraction estimation.
5. CSF and tissue correction.
6. Spatial registration to anatomical and template spaces.
7. Atlas projection and regional summary extraction.
8. Generation of voxelwise, regional, and connectomics-ready derivatives.
9. Automated quality-control reporting.

## Quality-Control Framework

MRSIPrep summarizes quality at the voxel, regional, and subject levels.
Voxel inclusion can be based on metabolite-specific criteria such as
linewidth, signal-to-noise ratio, Cramér-Rao lower bounds, tissue
composition, and spatial coverage.
